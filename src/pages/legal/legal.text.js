Note from Medicall: We encourage you to review our Privacy Policy so you feel comfortable with how your information is collected and used in our Service.
INTRODUCTION 
This Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) is incorporated into our Terms of Use. Therefore, terms used in this Privacy Policy that have been previously defined will have the same meanings as provided in our Terms of Use. As with our Terms of Use, if we make any changes to our Privacy Policy, we will post the revised Privacy Policy and update the “Last Revised” date of the Privacy Policy. Your use of our Service following any such change means you accept the revised Privacy Policy. 
We are committed to respecting the privacy of users of our Service. We created this Privacy Policy to tell you how Medicall collects, uses and discloses information in order to provide you with our Service. 
In addition, even though Medicall is not a “covered entity” as defined in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), your healthcare Provider assigned through our Service may be a “covered entity” and therefore subject to the provisions of HIPAA. As a result, your Provider has adopted a HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices (the “Notice of Privacy Practices”) to describe how your Provider uses and discloses your protected health information (“PHI”). In connection with certain services we provide to or on behalf of your Provider, your Provider has requested that we disseminate to you the Provider’s Notice of Privacy Practices, which is attached to this Privacy Policy. Medicall has agreed that its collection, use and disclosure of your PHI on behalf of your Provider will be done consistent with the Notice of Privacy Practices except to the extent you have authorized additional uses and disclosures under this Privacy Policy or other provisions of the Terms of Use. 
By accessing or using our Service, you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy; you hereby consent that we will collect, use and disclose your information as set forth in this Privacy Policy; and you acknowledge receipt of your Provider’s Notice of Privacy Practices. If you are using our Service on behalf of an individual other than yourself, you represent that you are authorized by such individual to accept this Privacy Policy and the Provider’s Notice of Privacy Practices on such individual’s behalf. 
Simply Stated: By using Medicall, you’re agreeing to this Privacy Policy and your Provider’s Notice of Privacy Practices.

Information regarding your location will be obtained directly from you when you provide us with your zip code.

Any information you provide us on behalf of your minor child will be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We do not knowingly collect information for individuals under the age of 13. If we learn that we have received any information for an individual under the age of 13, we will only use that information to respond directly to that child (or a parent, legal guardian or personal representative) to inform him or her that he or she cannot use our Service, and subsequently we will delete that information from our own servers.

Welcome to Medicall! 
We’re passionate about all the details of providing you with a great experience. In keeping with that goal, we’ve inserted “Simply Stated” explanations throughout our Terms of Use. These explanations are written in a way that makes our Terms of Use easy to understand. That being said, please remember you’re agreeing to all the fine print when you use Medicall, so we encourage you to read our Terms of Use carefully. Our Privacy Policy is included in our Terms of Use, and we take both the privacy and security of your data seriously. Above all else, we value your trust. 
One more thing … our Service is not intended for emergency situations, so if you have a medical emergency, call 911 immediately! 
Thank you for using Medicall. If you have any questions or concerns, please email us at obadri@gmail.com. 
Medicall is an interactive mobile application provided to you by Medicall, Inc. (“Medicall,” “our,” “us,”or “we”). Your access and use of the application or any part thereof, or anything associated with it, including its contents and any products or services provided by Medicall (collectively, the “Service”) are governed by these Terms of Use (this “Agreement”). The Service is intended for access and use only by U.S. customers. Please read this Agreement carefully before using the Service. 
Simply Stated: You must be a U.S. customer to use Medicall. Before using Medicall, please read the Terms of Use.
GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS 
By accessing or using our Service, you agree to be bound by this Agreement and to use our Service in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. If you do not agree to the terms and conditions of use for our Service as set forth in this Agreement, you may not use the Service. 
If we need to change the terms of this Agreement, we will post the revised Terms of Use through our Service and update the “Last Revised” date to reflect the date of the changes. You are responsible for being aware of any changes made to this Agreement. By continuing to use our Service after we post such changes, you agree to the terms of this Agreement, as modified.

WHAT SERVICE DOES MEDICALL PROVIDE? 
Our Service is designed to enable you to obtain telemedicine consultations and treatment for common medical conditions by facilitating the connection between you and a licensed healthcare provider (a “Provider”). Once you select one or more Providers through our Service, each of those Providers may be referred to as “your Provider.” Your Provider is solely responsible for providing you with medical care. We act as a technology platform to connect you with professional healthcare Providers who may be available to provide you with certain non-emergency medical care. We do not control or interfere with the practice of medicine by Providers, each of whom is responsible for the medical services he or she provides. 
Simply Stated: Medicall provides the technology to connect you with licensed healthcare Providers for non-emergency telemedicine consultations, but only your Provider can make decisions about your medical care and treatment.
IS THE SERVICE RIGHT FOR YOU? 
In some cases, our Service may not be the most appropriate way for you to seek medical care and treatment. For example, certain medical conditions may require an in-person procedure or very specialized providers not available through our Service. To assist you in determining whether our Service is a fit for your needs, we ask a series of initial questions during registration before we connect you with a Provider. Based on your responses to these questions, we may determine that our Service is not well suited to the particular issue for which you are seeking treatment. In such a case, you will receive an alert notifying you that you will be unable to use our Service for the particular issue you submitted and providing additional information regarding next steps. If this occurs, your registration will remain on file with Medicall, but you will not be connected with a Provider nor will you have established a physician relationship with any Provider. You will not be charged for any services provided to you in connection with your submission if we are unable to connect you with a Provider. You can return to Medicall at a later time to submit a request for another condition or issue. 
Simply Stated: We may determine that our Service is not appropriate for your particular medical condition or issue. If so, you will be notified that your submission has been halted and you will not be charged for your submission.
MEDICAL EMERGENCIES 
THE MEDICAL CARE YOU RECEIVE FROM YOUR PROVIDER THROUGH MEDICALL IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR OTHER MEDICAL TREATMENT YOU MAY NEED. IF YOU ARE EXPERIENCING A MEDICAL EMERGENCY, CALL 911 OR SEEK EMERGENCY MEDICAL HELP. 
Simply Stated: Once again, if you have a medical emergency, call 911 immediately!
REGISTRATION 
To use our Service, you are required to set up an account (“Account”). When you set up an Account, you are required to enter your name, email address, password (“Password”) and certain other information (e.g., date of birth, contact information, credit card information, and medical history). You agree that all information you provide is true, accurate, current and complete, and you agree to maintain and promptly update such information to keep it current.

Simply Stated: To use Medicall, you must live in a state where our Service is offered and be at least 18 years old or at least 13 years old and have obtained parental consent. You will create an account and provide the requested information in a truthful manner. Do not share your password.

Simply Stated: You agree that you will not misuse or abuse our Service, and you will not engage in any behavior that may be offensive or harmful to others. It is our responsibility to protect our responsible users from anyone who behaves inappropriately.
FEES AND PURCHASE TERMS 
The fees for telemedicine consultations with healthcare Providers can be found on our Service. Fees are subject to change, and may be at the discretion of the provider. It is your responsibility to remain informed about the current rates. Medicall, on behalf of your Provider, will charge you for medical services provided by your Provider, and you agree to pay for all medical services provided to you. 
You will provide Medicall with a valid credit card or any other method of payment accepted by us (“Payment Provider”) when you set up your Account with our Service. By providing Medicall with your Payment Provider and associated payment information, you agree that Medicall is authorized to invoice your Account at the time any payments are due and charge your designated Payment Provider account. If any payments are subject to sales tax in any jurisdiction, you also agree to pay the required sales tax, and any related penalties or interest. Medicall may automatically charge sales taxes for addresses within jurisdictions where such taxes are required. Unless otherwise agreed to by Medicall, all fees paid are non-refundable. You are responsible for all fees and charges associated with your Account. 
We use a third-party payment processor (the “Payment Processor”) to charge your Payment Provider account. The processing of payments in connection with your use of our Service will be subject to the terms, conditions and privacy policies of the Payment Processor and the Payment Provider responsible for your designated method of payment, in addition to this Agreement with Medicall. We are not responsible for any errors by the Payment Processor or the Payment Provider. 
At present we do not process any insurance claims, nor will your Provider process claims on your behalf. It is solely up to you to contact your health plan, determine whether your coverage applies, and submit a claim if applicable. You are responsible for the full fee charged for Provider care through our Service regardless of whether you later are able to receive reimbursement from your health plan for part or all of the cost. 
Simply Stated: The current fees for telemedicine consultations with healthcare Providers are posted on Medicall. You agree that Medicall is authorized to bill your account and charge your designated method of payment when payments are due, including any sales tax that may be required. Medicall and your healthcare Provider do not currently process insurance claims, and it is your responsibility to submit claims if your health plan provides coverage.

The validity, interpretation, construction and performance of these Terms of Use will be governed by the laws of the State of Massachusetts, without giving effect to the principles of conflict of laws. Any dispute arising under or relating to these Terms of Use will be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration in Boston, Massachusetts, under the rules of the American Arbitration Association, except that either party may bring a claim related to intellectual property rights, or seek temporary and preliminary specific performance and injunctive relief, in any court of competent jurisdiction, without the posting of bond or other security.

You may only resolve disputes with us on an individual basis and not as part of any class, consolidated or representative action. Our failure to enforce any provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right.

INFORMED CONSENT REGARDING USE OF TELEHEALTH TO DELIVER CARE
BY CLICKING “I AGREE,” CHECKING A RELATED BOX TO SIGNIFY YOUR ACCEPTANCE, USING ANY OTHER ACCEPTANCE PROTOCOL PRESENTED THROUGH THE SERVICE OR OTHERWISE AFFIRMATIVELY ACCEPTING THIS CONSENT, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ, ACCEPTED, AND AGREED TO BE BOUND BY THIS CONSENT. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS CONSENT, DO NOT CREATE AN ACCOUNT OR USE THE SERVICE. YOU HEREBY GRANT AGENCY AUTHORITY TO ANY PARTY WHO CLICKS ON THE “I AGREE” BUTTON OR OTHERWISE INDICATES ACCEPTANCE TO THIS CONSENT ON YOUR BEHALF.
PURPOSE
The purpose of this consent form (“consent”) is to provide you with information about telehealth and to obtain your informed consent to the use of telehealth in the delivery of healthcare services to you by physicians, physician assistants and nurse practitioners (“Providers” using the online platforms owned and operated by Medicall, Inc. (the “Service”)
USE OF TELEHEALTH
Telehealth involves the delivery of healthcare services using electronic communications, information technology or other means between a healthcare provider and a patient who are not in the same physical location. Telehealth may be used for diagnosis, treatment, follow-up and/or patient education, and may include, but is not limited to, one or more of the following: electronic transmission of medical records, photo images, personal health information or other data between a patient and a healthcare provider; interactions between a patient and healthcare providers via audio, video and/or data communications (such as secure messaging); use of output data from medical devices, sound and video files. Alternative methods of care may be available to you, such as in-person services, and you may choose an alternative at any time. Always discuss alternative options with your provider.
ANTICIPATED BENEFITS
The use of telehealth may have the following possible benefits: Making it easier and more efficient for you to access medical care and treatment for the conditions treated by your Provider(s); allowing you to obtain medical care and treatment by Provider(s) at times that are convenient for you; and enabling you to interact with Provider(s) without the necessity of an in-office appointment.
POTENTIAL RISKS
While the use of telehealth in the delivery of care can provide potential benefits for you, there are also potential risks associated with the use of telehealth and other technology. These risks include, but may not be limited to the following: the quality, accuracy or effectiveness of the services you receive from your Provider could be limited as the technology, including the Service, may contain bugs or other errors, including ones which may limit functionality, produce erroneous results, rendering part or all of such technology, including the Service, unavailable or inoperative, produce incorrect records, transmissions, data or consent, or cause records, transmissions, data or content to be corrupted or lost; failures of technology may also impact your Provider(s) ability to correctly diagnose or treat your medical condition; the inability of your Provider(s) to conduct certain tests or assess vital signs in-person may in some cases prevent the Provider(s) from providing a diagnosis or treatment or from identifying the need for emergency medical care or treatment for you; your Providers(s) may not be able to provide medical treatment for your particular condition and you may be required to seek alternative health care or emergency care services; delays in medical evaluation/treatment could occur due to unavailability of your Provider(s) or deficiency or failures of the technology oro electronic equipment used; the electronic systems or other security protocols or safeguards used could fail, causing a breach of the privacy of your medical or other information; given regularly requirements in certain jurisdictions, your Provider(s) diagnosis and/or treatment options, especially pertaining to certain prescriptions, may be limited; a lack of access to all of your medical records may result in adverse drug interactions or allergic reactions or other judgment errors.
FOLLOW-UP CARE; EMERGENCY SITUATIONS
If the situation is an emergency, call 911. In some situations, telehealth is not an appropriate method of care. If you require immediate or urgent care, you must seek care at an emergency room facility or other provider equipped to deliver urgent or emergent care. If you are not experiencing an emergency or do not require immediate or urgent care, you can communicate with Providers through the secure message service in the Platforms. If a technical failure prevents you from communicating with your Providers through the Platforms, you should call their office number.

Personal information that identifies you or contains protected health information will not be disclosed to any third party without your consent, except as authorized by law for the purposes of consultation, treatment, payment/billing, and certain administrative purposes, or as otherwise set forth in your Provider’s Privacy Policy.
