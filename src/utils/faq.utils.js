      title: '1. What is the custom formula (i.e. cream)?',
      content: `Your custom formula is a custom cream made for your unique skin by your dermatologist. It will be designed for your needs and goals to target skin concerns: type of acne, redness, discoloration, texture, and more. Your dermatologist will review your answers and photos, and prescribe custom ingredients &#8212; at a custom strength &#8212; for your skin's unique needs. Before each new shipment, we'll check in to see how you're doing and if needed, we'll adjust your prescription to ensure it is always the right fit for your skin.`,

      title: '2. What are the key ingredients?',
      content: `Your active ingredients and their strength level will be picked for your skin by your dermatologist. They may include: tretinoin, azelaic acid, tranexamic acid, niacinamide, and more. In addition to active ingredients, your formula will also include inactive, or base ingredients that help the medications blend into a silky smooth cream. All ingredients are vegan, cruelty-free, unscented, and paraben-free.`,

They'll design your custom formula, answer questions, and make adjustments as needed. So don't be a stranger. You can always message your dermatologist through your DermDoc account if you have questions. We're here for you.`,
